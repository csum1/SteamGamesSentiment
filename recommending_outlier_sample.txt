Am I the only one that sincerely can't understand the negative reviews?
I fully understand this game is not for everyone, but it is very apparent what type of game you're getting yourself into, from the graphics and specially the trailler...

[b]Controls:[/b] Don't expect mario. The controls are 100% fair if you don't mistime your jumps.
...And, yes, it can be quite hard a couple times. In this game, and there will be a few "omg so unfair" deaths. What about it?

[b]The Actual Difficulty:[/b] "Nintendo hard, but very forgiving?" From the "mixed" reviews I was fully expecting the game to throw me all the way back to stage 1 when I got a game over. Nope. Checkpoint every couple levels. Pretty standard.
Most of the difficulty is from the tight platforming, and the fact that that you lose your weapon when you die. Also, it's not in every stage you can recover your weapon, and even when you can, sometimes you have to take a riskier path to do so.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
As said before, a few of the deaths are gonna be "so unfair". Also, when you game over, the game sends you to the title screen, and doesn't even auto-selects "continue", so you manually have to press down. how dare they do this to us.
...That's it.

Just.... make sure you know what you're buying people..... it's not because it's on a $0,50 sale and not an adult game that you should automatically buy it, AND THEN review it badly because it's not your type of game... =-= jesus...

There's a BIG difference between "bad" game design, and "not my type of" game design.

Analogue: A Hate Story takes place in the 26th century, where the universe is run by the Saeju Colony Historical Society. Dispatch Control sends their secret black ops team to do their dirty work, the Mugunghwa security team, led by *Hyun-ae. Following Dispatch Control's orders and assassinating those whom they believe are criminals, Mugunghwa security kill a man known as Emperor Ryu, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Mugunghwa security. *Hyun-ae and his team realize they have been duped by Dispatch Control and desert, becoming space pirates on the run from Dispatch Control's forces.
Ten years later, *Hyun-ae drunkenly attacks Dispatch Control's battlecruiser, the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, while near the ship of Mugunghwa. *Hyun-ae rams the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, hoping to gain revenge on Dispatch Control. The ships collide, forcing both to crash land on the hull of Mugunghwa. One of *Hyun-ae's men, *Mute, is critically wounded in the crash and *Hyun-ae is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the ship, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. *Hyun-ae fights through to one of the salvage ship from the beginning of the game's escape pods, and retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an "instinct leash." The leash, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.
*Hyun-ae returns with the cell, and while *Mute is under operation, the mutants attack their ship, leaving *Mute a disfigured cyborg. *Hyun-ae and *Mute, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the ship, despite *Mute's disapproval of *Hyun-ae's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads *Hyun-ae to another escape pod, where they find a UNIX command-line terminal, a salvage ship from the beginning of the game security soldier who agrees to work with *Hyun-ae and *Mute, but only after they rescue Dispatch Control. As they battle through the ravaged city, a UNIX command-line terminal explains that Mugunghwa has been used by salvage ship from the beginning of the game security as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When *Hyun-ae learns that a UNIX command-line terminal was Emperor Ryu's daughter, he tells her that Dispatch Control was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.
The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Dispatch Control's pod landed. a UNIX command-line terminal accuses Dispatch Control of her father's death, but he simply pushes her off the side of the building. Dispatch Control then warns *Hyun-ae and *Mute that there is an armed "DNA bomb" on the salvage ship from the beginning of the game that will wipe out all life on the ship, and they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. As they travel underground, Dispatch Control explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the ship; they rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the ship's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation.
Aboard the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, Dispatch Control tricks *Hyun-ae and *Mute into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves them to die. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by a UNIX command-line terminal, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.

[h1]Roguelike Co-Op Dungeon Crawler[/h1]
https://youtu.be/xmwcSZrk1mg
+ The gameplay is good. This game is more of a dungeon crawler as you go from area to area clearing out creatures in search for loot. 
+ Visually the game looks great with some truly large scale environments with lots to explore as you continue to progress deeper and deeper.
+ You can join up with friends and play co-op. I played alone, but I highly recommend playing with friends as it will make the game far more entertaining.
+ A great crafting / loot / shop system. Generally, when you kill an enemy you can take their weapons / shields, and will commonly find ingredients or gems which you can use to craft food, potions, and so fourth very easily along with buy things from the shops.
+ Pretty challenging (at least playing Solo) as you have limited ways to heal, many enemies to defeat,  and due to the nature of the combat system it can be fairly easy to get caught and stunned if get yourself surronded by enemies.

- The game is a bit too slow paced for my liking. The combat and movement speed is a bit sluggish, and stiff and at times making each encounter feel a bit mundane.
- The story is a bit too vague. I'm asusming you are meant to find out for yourself as you explore, but I felt like the game was missing the drive or reward to continue. What am I fighting for? What am I trying to find? Why am I going through these large maze-like dungeons? Since when you die you start back at the beginning, I feel like I did not have enough motivation to continue.
- The Stamina / energy / hunger bar seems to deplete far too quickly, and will only recharge if you eat.  I felt as if I was eating constantly as everytime my stamina dropped I  could no longer do combo / power attacks which I found to be annoying.

I love tower defense games, been playing them since the first starcraft mods, lately Warstone TD, Gemcraft Series and of course Kingdom Rush + Frontiers. I couldn't resist buying this TD game with 50% discount.
Good:[list]
[*]There is a wide variety of towers (including flame, ice, laser) and clearly, some are much better for certain levels or placement spots than others, e.g. obviously placing the AoE towers in front and the hard-hitting single damage towers towards your base to pick of runners or the heavily armored foes that get through the slaughter, also it's very satisfying to place a few flame towers on a very long path and watch the enemies just slowly burn to a crisp as they try to get through a mile of burning hell.
[*]There is an even bigger variety of mostly flashy and very effective spells that cost mostly mana and sometimes gold, including fire tornadoes, blizzards, flash freeze, traps, mass repair.
[*]You get exp for every enemy slain and are totally free to distribute skill points balanced on new towers and tower upgrades as well as into the opposite skill path of better and crazier spells and mana upgrades, or you could go down just the path you like more, everything seems to work.
[*]Extremely customizable with lots of shortcuts you can allocate, different difficulties and even the option to switch tower damage on or off. Some enemies can damage your towers and you have to repair them, which is imho how this game should be played and is balanced around, but some won't like the added fuss, so just switch it off and at least play on the hardest difficulty then to offset this, otherwise you'll just swim in gold and have no way to spend it. Also lots of graphics options.
[*]The graphics overall are very detailed and the levels, towers, enemies and especially the spell effects are obviously lovingly crafted. With a Ryzen 5 2600 and a 1070 I can maintain 144 fps at 1440p on maxed out settings only when no enemies are on the screen, for fluid gameplay during large waves I had to scale back.
[*]You can quickly switch between three different game speeds so you can micromanage in difficult situations and accelerate the boring parts.[/list]
Neutral:[list]
[*]The graphics to me look a bit sterile, in the way that Age of Empires looks sterile when compared to Warcraft. The game is aiming for a more realistic look, the main problem with this imho is that the enemies are really hard to tell apart as they have no big exaggerated features.
[*]There's no world map. It's not a big deal for me and the mission list does its job, but some immersion is missing because of this.
[*]The story is very basic. I don't expect a twisting, complicated, intruiging storyline for a TD game obviously, so it's no biggie.[/list]
Can and should still be optimized / changed:[list]
[*]The area you can scroll around in is severely restricted, and worse, when you zoom in, you can't scroll farther to the edges, you're still stuck at the same x,y-coordinates that are the boundaries when zoomed out, meaning you'll always have to play on maxed zoomed out setting, otherwise you can't see a large part of the inbound enemies until they're standing right at your first towers.
[*]When frame rates drop, scrolling gets choppy and slower, so getting around the big maps (and you have to when surveying all the enemy paths) feels like a chore. At least include a scroll speed setting please.
[*]Tying into this, sounds get much louder when you're zoomed in and very low when zoomed out. This is realistic but bad design in this case, as you're almost always zoomed out and the combat sounds are almost inaudible while the UI sounds and music stay at full volume, so you're almost shocked every time you get an error sound because the spell you want to use is still on cooldown. Also, you feel very detached from the fighting on the ground when you can barely hear it, which adds to the sterile overall feel.
[*]There are still some typos in the descriptions and unit names (e.g. a quick look in the bestiary yields "beserker", "presense", "in it's path" instead of "in its path", ...)[/list]
Overall, it's worth the price, because it's quite different from most TD games with a very impactful, interesting skill tree and great 3D graphics with rotatable maps and impressive, satisfying spells that make you really *feel* like a godlike mage. I'll continue playing through it, but don't expect an extremely long, balanced and polished game, this one has different strengths. Not to say that it couldn't be quite a bit better with a few more updates still :)[/list]

Edit after finishing this game: The last campaign, defending against the undead, is distinctly better than the first two thirds of the game. The more dramatic and memorable orchestral score was a nice contrast to the nondescript background music earlier. The snow effect is very well done and adds some atmosphere. And, not least, the difficulty really ramps up the last few levels. You'll always have to be on the lookout for Shadows running through and stunning all your towers, and use every tool at your disposal to stop them early. Which also highlighted the problem with the near indistinguishability of most units, as it would be nice to see them at a glance when panning around instead of trying to find them by looking near your stunned towers...
But overall, it was fun playing through it and I recommend Hold the Fort, although I don't see me restarting on the highest difficulty.

This is an... interesting game. The story appears to be a story with another. The princess has made a pact with a demon, but now needs to break it by hunting down demons across the world and killing them. But all of this is a tale written by a girl who is fighting her own demons in this way (through the story she is writing).

Whether that is a glimpse into the actual author, or another layer of storytelling... tricky to tell.

Still, it appears to be a good game. Give it a try.

This game is very unique. If I had to give an analagous comparison, I'd say it'd be the lovechild between a single-player Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Air Hockey. If that made absolutely no sense, then continue reading.

This game has several stages you can choose from, and only one fixed difficulty. Completing a stage unlocks the next stage, and you can play any stage at will. The first stage is a low-key tutorial with passive messages explaining the game's mechanics, but it's not a tutorial stage; it's the first stage. The controls are very simple; use the directional keys to move, one button to shoot, and another button to charge up your 'bomb' which clears many bullets around you. These controls, as well as the game's resolution (options limited to 160x120, 320x240, 640x480, 800x600, and 1280x960) and fullscreen/windowed settings can be changed in the config menu option upon startup, but cannot be changed in-game.

Gameplay consists of maneuvering your character through whatever bullets may be present and firing your one shot straight forward. Yes, one; you can only have one shot on screen at a time, but it's not nearly as bad as it sounds. Your shot removes whatever bullets it hits along its path and disappears once it rebounds off the other side and goes through the bottom of the screen. The objective is to shoot the frequently spawning red and blue shapes which, when shot, will move in the direction you shot them and explode after a short time, doing damage to enemies and clearing bullets in a set radius. If you shoot a shape into another shape of the same color, it will cause a chain explosion, clearing even more bullets and doing more damage. Because your standard shot does very little damage on its own, boss battles are a constant battle of positioning, spacing, and carefully shooting the shapes into clusters of bullets, clearing them off the screen and subsequently damaging the boss.

In conclusion, this game's alright. It's very unique and feels weird at first, but doesn't take too long to get used to. Because your character has a health bar (that can be replenished if you do a super awesome chain reaction explosion), if you get hit with several bullets, it's not an instant game-over unlike several other danmaku games I've played. In that sense, it's rather forgiving, but in no way does that make it easy; as early as stage 2, the game expects you to have a firm understanding of the game's mechanics. I would definitely recommend this game if you want a new and unique take on the shoot-em-up genre, especially if it goes on sale.

[spoiler]I [i]really[/i] like the art style and how fuzzy the character's clothes look, but that has nothing to do with gameplay.[/spoiler]

I really tried to like this game but the irregular slowing of the gun and the aiming up close is horrible too many times. It misses bullets that are critical when zombies are near.

Hi all,

I will present this review in different segments depending on if you are:
1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)
2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)
3) everyone else (EE)

First the TL:DR version:

1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)

You have been waiting for this game since the first time you critted the Ogre mercenary. It's here. Go buy it. Oh wait, its not a straight conversion like BB? Hmmm. Well then have a look below to see if this adaptation is for you. Yes there are some bugs and yes the AI is not great, but this is meant to be played vs friends anyway right?

2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)

If you like levelling units, creating a unique warband in a medievalesque, semifantasy setting where death lurks around every corner, where every conseqence is final (no re-doing ANYTHING) in a turnbased environment that you can play vs the AI or vs a friend online, then this might be for you. If you do not like permadeath and rather be able to reload a battle until you get that perfect win: stay away. 

3) everyone else (EE)
Well actually see 2. You wouldnt be reading this if you were looking for a great footballmanager now would you? :)

See below for a more detailed description. Use ctrl-f to quickly find your part. 

1) If you are  a GW fanatic and familiar with the TT version. (GWF)

I'm betting you have been waiting for a vid adaptation of TT for ages. Well here it is. So go get it. I'm thinking for you the most important question is: 

Is this Mordheim?

The answer is both yes and no. (isnt that great ;) ). 

No because this is NOT a straight conversion (Like BB for instance). Some mechanics have been changed, see below. 
Yes because this is indeed the city of Mordheim and how you always wanted it to look. 
Yes, because in essence its about levelling units, gathering wyrdstone.
Yes because its unforgiving, no turning back, no savescumming, no redo if you pick a wrong skill. This can be frustrating but never more so than in the original because there progression was basically random (yeah! +1 Initiative for my skaven assassin, woot woot! Not).

So whats different, whats the same?

Main similarities are:
-turnbased mechanic
-injuries and levelling
-climbing
-charging
-critical hits
-wyrdstone gathering/selling
-most weapons of the TT are in
-and some skills. 
-there is RNG ('dicerolls')
-psychology

Main differences:
-the turn-bases system is unit-, not warband based (so units alternate turns according to an initiative ladder instead of complete warbands ).
-the skillset has been changed with many new skills, some familiar but many that are new.
-there are a lot more stats which have a lot higher thresholds. 
-dodge is no longer a 'skill' (like sidestep) but together with parry, overwatch and ambush are selectable stances that finish a units turn (and activate when a unit is in range or attacks). 
-warband rosters have been changed around a little to make them more similar.
-stuff like fear and terror behave differently from the TT etc. 
-There is an action pool for movement and reloading and such, another one for attacks and spells and such.
-There are no wounds but each unit has a health bar, and thus units damage for health not wounds. 
-Deployment is not the same as in the TT as the nodes you can deploy in a are predefined. 

You might not like all the changes they've made to the game. For me, in the end, the similarities outweight the changes which I see as an attempt to recreate the game for a vritual medium. 

Again, if you like GW and like(d) the TT this is a must-have. Watch some lets-plays if you are unsure about the new ruleset. 

2) If you are a general fantasy/tactics lover. (GFTL)
Then you don't really care much about the comparison with the TT because you never played it. You know the GW universe perhaps but have never been into their miniature games. However, if you do like fantasy stuff then the setting of this game will appeal to you. There are ratmen, there are horribly mutated creatures, regular mercs, and some crazy nuns with hammers. Sounds good? Read on. 

This game is basically an X-com type game. Units take turns on a map, that represents a district in the city of Mordheim, a Medievalesque city that has been hit by a meteor so its somewhat in shambles. You and your band are there to gather fragments of this meteor (called wyrdstone). Since the meteor hit however the City of Mordheim has become somewhat unpleasant. 
So what are some features of this game? 

-procedural maps that retain their basic layout (street here, square there) but are different each time, (hey last time this building was still standing now its gone/missing the topfloor/completely ruined etc.) creating new routes, blockades etc. each time you play. 
-customizable units (appearance and playstyle).
-many many skills. 
-units progress and become better or get hurt and die. 
-non-obligatory story missions 
-four warbands with distinct playing style. UPDATE: with the current DLC there are six warbands, the two new warbands will also appear as adversaries without the DLC. There are also four new heroes, two for each side: Order and Destruction. 
-MP play possible (but limited in its options, i.e. no matchmaking or rankings or whatever). 
-variety of weapons, spells and units to equip, level and master. 

-Difficulty: I think its important to note this from the get-go. This game is not easy, esp if you are a newcomer. RNG mechanics seem to favor the AI (as they always seem to do :) ), your captain can go Out of Action (OOA) during the match by failing three 80% parry chances and end up post-match losing his leg, being megalomaniac or worse, plain dead. As in terminaly, no turning back, no re-loading dead. And he just turned level 6. And now he's dead. Get the picture? If you are hoping for an easy game stay away, because you will ragequit so often you'll develop haemerroids. The next point ties in with this. 

-[u]alt-f4 is punished[/u]. If you, for any reason abort the game, the engine will treat it as if you ran away from battle and all your units are considered to have gone OOA. This means they all get to roll for injuries. This could mean your warband is crippled and its startover time. Is there no save? Well offc there is. But you can't reload it to 're-do' something. If you mess up and charge a deamon with your level 1 youngblood and he's dead, he's dead, and he stays dead. No turning back. 

So let's say that you like all this? Anything else? Well yes. While the game might be difficult because of how it works, the AI is not very, you know, smart. In fact, given some practice, you will be able to defeat the AI on the hardest missions unless you are unlucky with your deployment. On higher difficulty missions the AI gets a health and damage boost and that goes a long way to increase the challenge. But if you are looking for a really hardcore challenge in tactical terms you need to play online because the AI will not deliver.
Also, the story missions can be a bit of a chore sometimes, but hey, they are optional, so the game doesn't force these on you. 

But still, even with an AI thats not perfect (and let's face it, in which complicated game is the AI ever perfect? Total War, I'm looking at you, you money-receiving, morale boosted, stackbuilding, mapsitting incompentent!) this game is many hours of absolute fun. The maps are beautifully created with lots of attention to detail and winning matches can be exhilarating. Especially online where they are butt-clinching, sweat-drenching affairs.

slowly, really, but just enough to make you want to run the fuck outta there so you don't have to hear all the fucked up shit coming from everywhere you dont want noises to come from.
No place that actually SHOULD contain a jumpscare does so, and the spooky shit that COMES outta nowhere wont leave you alone: when you get to do something when your nerves are completely wrecked from all the odd noises, you will panic.
and do it all wrong.
and you will die.
horribly.
then trial and error.

god damn i hate this game so much i love it!
my fucked up nerves were definetely worth the 4.99€ i paid.
The sad story is truly sad, and if i woulnt leave computer once in a while to regular bathroom visits, i would most likely cry to the story alone.

i loved it.

[b]Failed Adventurer[/b] is a lewd "match three" game about a man with newfound demonic power on a rape-quest to extract vengeance from those who kicked him out of town!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Though Failed Adventurer shares mechanical similarities as "match-three" games, it is not a match-three game. Instead of rotating pairs of "beads", you simply click on groups of two or more like-beads to eliminate them from the board; whichever bead you select will "level up" (provided you removed enough beads). When sufficiently leveled up, any bead can become a "S" bead. "S" beads remove all like-beads from the playing board, granting extraordinary effects (and making it easier to level up new beads). As beads are removed from the game, new ones take their place. The creation of "S" beads and management of new beads is essential to winning the game. There are three kinds of beads; two deal damage, and one recovers hit points. There is no time limit, but there is still a sense of urgency. Many foes have one or more skills and attacks that can lock the board and deliver painful, stacking damage.

[h1]Sexual Content[/h1]
There are nine sex-scenes (and one bonus, lewd image that isn't in the gallery). Each scene is comprised of a single, animated CG with one or more variations for progression and climax. There isn't any activity -- you just click until the end. The artwork is a delight; it's beautifully rendered, and the animations are quality. I loved watching the expressions on the female protagonists' faces. The male protagonist is deliberately designed to be a villiaous rapist; I'm skeptical anyone is going to be rooting for him. He looks like a total douche bag (mission accomplished Srloop?) The English doesn't owe to finely crafted fap material; it's weirdly formatted, and the word choice is bizarre. Other than the weird dialogue, I enjoyed the sexual material. Most of the sex-scenes are rape and humiliation.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Lol go buy it (actually, this is a decent game, but it's a pretty easy game with poor English; keep that it mind.) It's a bit pricey for the price, but it's totally worth picking up if lewd "match three" games are your thing.

The only thing scary is the cardboard cut outs

This is one of my favorite games of all time, and easily one of the most criminally unknown. I found this game in 2015 from a Youtube video and instantly fell in love with it. I decided to pick up the Steam version recently because I had never completed it on the hardest Mibibli difficulty and wanted to see the new additions. 

While at first glance this seems like just another indie retro platformer, Mibibli's Quest does a lot to differentiate itself from the pack. The surrealist theme allows for unique mechanics that wouldn't be possible otherwise and keeps each level fresh and exciting. For example, there's a level where enemies shoot directional arrows at you and you have to press the corresponding button in order to not get hit, sort of like Dance Dance Revolution. The game also switches genre multiple times; I especially liked a shoot em up level towards the end. The bizarre dialogue and characters are hilarious and very memorable, even though most only appear once. The soundtrack is fantastic, and years later I still get the catchy tunes stuck in my head. Ryan (the developer) clearly poured his heart into the game and it shows. 

The game does come with some downsides though. The lack of a pause button is a major flaw that can't be overlooked, as well as the lack of options such as key binding, sound, etc. This game is also brutally hard even on double easy difficulty, and the later levels especially will give even platforming veterans a tough time. You do get a cross item that lets you skip one tricky section each level, but even with that it can take dozens of tries to beat a level, and you should expect to die a lot. Luckily the game is very fair, and has tight controls, good level design, and (for the most part) predictable enemy patterns. Most of my deaths were my fault, and were due to either poor strategy or bad platforming on my part. Also, if you ever get stuck on a section, you can always go to another level in the hub world and try again later.

If you get easily frustrated (or offended), this game isn't for you. However, if you're a fan of platforming, and want to play one of the most bizarre, idiosyncratic hidden gems of the last decade, Mibibli's Quest won't disappoint.

You work as a bouncer that got to earn money by checking who comes into the club or not. For each day that passes it becomes more challenging (more things to check and remember). The concept is fun, and this is well executed except for one  semi-major flaw: The controls. 

You can use keys to "work faster" but the system unfortunaly bogs you constantly with dialogue you got to click trough. So even if you know someone is safe or not, you still cant send them on their way or let them in. No no. You got to meticously sit and click trough their trite conversation and listen to some shit. This is insanly stressful for two reasons. 

1) You loose all flow and the system is not able to work as fast as you are. You will be infuriatingly pissed off at the game when it keeps throwing dialogue at you when all you want to do is work. Get ready to swear a LOT

2) The system seems to feed the line of people quite randomly but the more that you got to check for - the less viable clients are in the line. I had a day with only two clients that was inside as the rest tried to fake id's, was the wrong age or similar. This can also be infuriating - but still acceptable. But it DOES tend to lean heavily on the "naughty" side. There are about 3 people trying to sneak in to ever 1 person that is legal. 

3) Which brings us to number 3. If you do not toss enough people into the club - your bouncer mate will start complaining. Which goes back to nr 1. Just. leave. me. the. heck. alone. to. work!!!!! but fracking no! He will be in your ear crying every 10 seconds and because of that you work even more slow. 

I would give this game a thumbs up on price, but the devs should SERIOUSLY considering uncluttering the pace. For a game that relies on you working fast - it is like doing a sprint with an anchor behind you. The game can NOT keep the pace you want to go - and as a result you just get PISSED at it. But there is a gem in here. 

I would give it a 6/10 now and worth the money. 
I would give it a much higher score if they sorted out the sluggish UI/code/whatever.

Oh: and for a game that says you got to work FAST before the days end - a clock or timer or ANYTHING indicating how much time you got would help severly. I am unsure if it actually DOES clock down - or if it just feeds you people and cuts it when it feels like. 

Recomended: But DEVS FIX THE SLUG!

Dead Secret is a point and click murder mystery horror game. It's takes around two hours to finish depending on how quickly you can solve the puzzles. There are multiple endings depending on how you handle the murder case and the clues you find. 

The story was very compelling and discovering more about the suspects and the victim was quite fun on its own. I would definetly recommend this game and if you can play it with a VR headset then please do!

10/10 perfectly timed scares and ambience

An action RPG dungeon crawler with souls-like gameplay and taking place in a dark purgatory world full of undead and spirits.

After falling for a trap in one of the dungeons, we find ourselves in this parallel dimension, where we need to fight our way from one dungeon floor to the next. Our naked spirit alone is quite vulnerable and limited on abilities, but we have something to mitigate that - we have an ability to usurp bodies of the enemies and to take control of them. Once we've brought an enemy's health down and if we have enough mana, we possess their body and it becomes our own. Each time we possess a new enemy, it gets unlocked at the vendor, so we can start in that body already if we have enough gold to afford it.

This possession ability allows us to make tactical choices prior to facing the dungeon and the bosses. It also potentially provides us with free health bars, because if we run low on health, we can possess another enemy and have a new health bar, so long as we have enough mana that is. This is a pretty fun mechanic that adds an interesting twist on the standard souls-like formula.

Since it was inspired by Dark Souls and similar games, its combat feels very much like those games. Heavy strikes that need to be timed properly, dodging, blocking, waiting for the right moment to strike, easy to get ganged up on and cornered, environmental kills, and so on. The main difference really is in the view angle, as here it's a bit more of an elevated angle, looking down, rather than directly behind the player.

The gameplay is mainly a dungeon crawler akin to roguelikes. We need to take down the boss of the dungeon in order to proceed to the next floor. If we die, we return back to the hub world and will have to do the whole dungeon run again. Depending on how many enemies we killed in the previous run, we'll have some amount of gold that we can spend at the vendor to buy gear before tackling the dungeon again. However, any unspent gold is lost. This gameplay formula can feel somewhat repetitive at times as we go through the same motions really each time we retry and there's not much else to do in dungeons other than fighting and opening an occasional treasure chest.

When we discover and interact with shrines guarded by miniboss enemies, we get a new skill point. These can be used to level up our basic stats.

The game currently in its early access state has a good battle system that feels satisfying and a clear direction, so I think now it mainly needs to refine some aspects of the gameplay so that it feels less repetitive, and also to add more variety in a form of enemies, weapons, things to do in dungeons, and environments. Those who enjoy souls-like games, should feel right at home here. Aside from that, a few updates to the UI could be useful as well, especially when the player is navigating through the menus with a controller.

There's no replacing the experience of playing this on a tiny table at a convention, choked by the atmosphere of a local industry that has, in part, aided and abetted the very same evils that have made this game much more than a standard single screen arcade game. The game's almost comical heavy handedness fades when confronted by a high score list populated by real names, by real people you've probably walked past in the very same halls.

It's the game that has stayed on my mind the most, years after having played it. Playing it alone on your own computer is a worse experience, but you're all the more worse off for not playing this at all.

Disclosure: I was given a free key by the developer.

-=The Good=-

Stylish vector visuals
Good music
Interesting combination of gameplay styles
Solid controls
Centipede-inspired bonus levels
Multiple game modes


-=The Bad=-

Unkillable enemies
Occasional cheap deaths
Low powerup drop rate
Slow "Hyper" filling


-=The Details=-

The game itself is an interesting combo-pack of ideas, some of which are borrowed from Flump Studios' previous game, Horizon Shift (HS). From the vector graphic-designed enemies that look like they could have been in HS, to the animation playing faintly behind all of the action, it screams HS in look and presentation. However, the similarities end there for the most part. This is basically a twin-stick shooter, as you control the gun with the right stick, and movement with the left. But rather than just move around freely over the entire play area ala Smash TV or Robotron 2084, you're main area is along the bottom of the screen not unlike Space Invaders or Galaga.  From there, you'll go after the red and green enemies for score and bonuses while avoiding their bullets by either moving/jumping out of the way, or bouncing off of blue objects to make yourself invincible.

Yes, you heard right, you'll be jumping and bouncing in this game. By jumping onto a low-moving blue object (or using a wall jump like in NES' Ninja Gaiden to reach a higher blue object), you become invincible to bullets and enemies. Not only that, the destroyed blue objects leave gems behind for you to collect either by hitting the floor and catching as many as you can as they fall, or by hitting the ceiling and getting them all. Another perk of the blue enemies is that bouncing off of them allows you to absorb bullets to fill up a Hyper meter that can be used to unleash a large blast that destroys most enemies (or get a big bonus... if you know how). As a bonus, if you can destroy groups of green ships, you gain a star. And if you collect five stars, you get taken to a bonus level at the end of the current stage to fight in what is clearly an homage to Centipede.

The action starts slow, but gradually builds into a frenzied skirmish of shooting, avoiding and collecting. The bosses in the game are the same way; starting off simple, but getting more demanding with each new one in terms of how you damage it and its bullet patterns. Thankfully, the controls are responsive and the hit detection seems to be on point as well. And as you frantically do all of this, you'll have some enjoyable music to listen to thanks to the OST that features catchy, synthy beats.

Sounds good, right? And for the most part, it is. But there are some issues with the game. First and foremost, are the unkillable enemies. This is a personal taste thing, but I HATE enemies you can't kill, especially when there are a lot of them. I've always felt they were a somewhat cheap way to add difficulty to a stage or section (I'm all for making a given enemy-type tough, but not indestructible). And sadly, this game features these undying things in the form of laser cannons that fire when you touch the ground, laser cannons that fire at timed intervals, and buzzsaws that go around the edges of the entire play area. All you can do is avoid them, which gets tedious after awhile and frustrating toward the end of the game... especially when they cause an unfair death.

Yes, this game has them too. There have been times where I beat the level, but triggered the floor laser cannons just as the level was ending. The result was the cannon's firing while the rest of the stage was blowing up. More than once, I found myself unavoidably falling into the laser blast and losing a life as the stage ended. I also encountered similarly unfair deaths after dropping from the ceiling. See, when you touch the ceiling and get all of the gems on-screen, you drop to the floor again. The problem is, you can't land on any blue objects as you fall. You just pass through them due to the invincibility you're given at that moment. When you hit the floor again, you become vulnerable again right away and that's where I got killed by bullet groups that I couldn't avoid thanks to how hectic things start getting around the mid-way point of the game.

A final pair of complaints come from the way powerups are handed out and how long it takes to fill the Hyper meter. It seems as if the powerups drop rather infrequently, and I've yet to figure out if it's because I'm not doing something right/often enough to trigger them, or if the game's just stingy with them. Either way, you really start feeling under-powered when you play through 15 stages and only get one powerup (if you're lucky). Lastly, the Hyper meter always seems to take forever to fill. And as if that weren't enough, I've watched it get emptied out without using it or dying. I'm still trying to figure out if that last part's intentional, or a bug in the game.

So in the end, what can be said about Hyper Bounce Blast? It's a fun little game and at 30 somewhat short levels, it can be a one-sitting type of game as well. The visuals, the music, the gameplay, several modes to choose from... it all works together pretty well to make for an entertaining game that keeps you on your toes. But issues like questionable deaths, unkillable enemies and some potentially iffy powerup frequency choices put a few blemishes on this game's vector graphics-inspired visage. So while it is a game I recommend, it's one that could have used a few tweaks in my opinion.

Score- 7.5 / 10

I am tempted to call this a knockoff of This War Of Mine in a medieval setting because it does copy most of the mechanics of that game, though to this game's credit, they put a lot of polish into the mechanics and thus it has a smoother feel to it. It has a lot of the same design elements. There is a day and night cycle where during the day you are building up your base to make your life easier while during the night you are sneaking through the city and scavenging for supplies. This game adds a twist where you are supplying your local soldiers with food, medicine, fortifications, and weapons so they can better combat the invading enemy. It is well done and a fun experience of waiting out a tense and prolonged siege, though I am keenly aware of its similarities to This War of Mine.

Cloud: Yes

Runers is a twin-stick style roguelike. Unlike most roguelikes, this one comes closer to being one. It's also crazy fast-paced. Being a real-time game, there's very little opportunity to plan out your moves and attacks. While you can pause the game at any time, the sheer speed and volume of bullets, enemies, hazards, and repositioning effects makes dodging difficult. Add to that a low invulnerability period when hit, and you will find it is very easy to die in this game.

I underwent a strange journey in my experience with Runers. I began with the curiosity phase. The game seemed simple enough - fantasy Smash TV with procerdurally generated levels. It sounded intriguing, and I gave it a whirl. After the tutorial, the game opens up with a fairly large character selection screen, my weakness. I made what I thought would be a melee character, a Dwarven Paladin. I started the Wimpy-level game, and noticed I was throwing ranged attacks. How odd! I tried to play him like a melee character, and while he did okayish, the only reason he survived was because of the generous life drops on the first floor. That didn't last very long, however, as the life drops became more and more scarce as I went down, and I finally died. After a few more class and spell combinations, and that's when became clear - this game doesn't have a proper melee combat system. Sure you can craft a sword spell, but you'll get obliterated pretty quickly if you keep that up. Fair enough, now was the time to experiment.

The next phase of the game was discovery. Having made my first double-rune spells, and seeing how much better they were, I got excited and wanted to make all of them and see what suited me best. I tested all the races and classes to see what they would bring to the table. The opposition was tough, but I was careful and prepared. I made my way to the first boss of the game, Blazia. After a long, dangerous fight, Blazia's tactics suddenly changed drastically. Her fire maze is where I promptly got my ass handed to me. The next run, I made it down there again, but instead found Dash. Dash was much easier to combat, and I beat him without much trouble. The next few floors, the scarcity of health drops did me in, as it seemed to do quite often. After a few more runs, I finally made it to the 10th floor, and beat the game. But wait, I didn't unlock anything at all! So I tried the next difficulty level. And, well, that didn't go so well.

Figuring that I would need the powers of triple-rune spells to make any meaningful progress, the time came to discover all 285 spells. This phase of the game was tedium. I can't begin to tell how grueling it is to get triple combiners. This process would have been so much more enjoyable if the triple combiners were not needed. It's not like players are going to find crazy good spells right off the bat, because there's such a large volume of lackluster triple-rune spells. When so much time is spent to waste one triple combiner with three runes that could have been used for something meaningful, that's just adding insult to injury. The Runedex helps out a little with this problem thanks to categorization, but you're still probably going to make a worthless spell regardless.

After forty hours or so, I managed to acquire and test every spell in the game. Now came the revenge phase. I planned out which spells I would want to use from now on, and forged my way ahead. Armed with the tools I wanted, what was once fiendishly difficult became manageable. The game is still plenty tough, but I successfully made it through a few more difficulty levels. Still stuggling with higher difficulty levels, I suddenly discovered something far more potent than any triple-rune spell. I can only assume it to be a bug, but this skill provided grossly overpowered buffs, to the point where I could decimate rooms at will. For this reason I was able to plow through Apocalypse difficulty, a worthy end to the crazy hard game.

Now onto the nitpicking. 
-The game is poorly optimized, even in low performance mode. There is	` drastic slowdown when a lot of action is going on, especially when you crank up the size of bullets and swarm the screen with effects.
- Global cooldowns in the game are not intuitive. When you have many low CD spells, some won't trigger because the game doesn't adequately explain about this.
- The lack of auto-fire for other skill slots seems pointless, since the game implements a global cooldown system for every spell.
- The races and classes could use rebalancing. I imagine many of them are unused because they are simply not competitve.
- Leveling up feels weak most of the time because selections tend to be poor. You don't even gain HP or other stats, unless you pick a skill that does so.
- There's far too many weak triple-rune spells. Either these should be buffed, or triple combiners should be removed. There's so many spells to learn, but if people rarely get to see them, what was the point in making them?
- I'm not sure if the game mentions that spells do not require combiners once it's in your Runedex. At the very least the game should probably mention this on the inventory screen.
- Every hostile room locks you in for a fight to the death. This gets old pretty quick. I'd kill for a spell that lets me open doors or something. Or leave some doors open to begin with.
- Occasionally monsters will spawn right next to the entrance of the room.
- Enemies use the same bullets you do. For this reason, it's difficult to tell when something belongs to an enemy or not.
- Some enemies leave lingering effects well after they die, such as Mud Golems. Oftentimes I re-enter a cleared room and still find the effect lingering there.
- Repositioning attacks are excessive. Spending lots of time not being in control of your character is unfun.
- Minibosses are oddly harder than real bosses themselves. At least tone down their firing rates.
- The damage output of some enemies is far too high, such as necro skeletons (which shouldn't be ranged!). Since there is a very low invulnerability period, you will often suffer multiple hits at a time.
- Most single-target spells are not competitive. In general it's best to use spells that can level entire rooms.
- The game as a whole is just too fast. Even some enemies are faster than you. Trying to dodge the fireball room without spells is just ludicrous. And because some enemies move so fast, it's bloody difficult to hit them with single-target bullet spells, which makes up a large portion of the Runedex. The ability to pause is no excuse for making everything move so fast.
- I would have liked equipment such as robes, and cash to buy things from shops.
- How about a way to mash 3 runes into a new random one?
- It would be nice if there was an icon above your character sprite to show status afflictions such as confusion.
- Allies or hirelings would be a fun addition (not including the escort or class abilities). Something more permanant.
- I found a couple game-breaking bugs.

Runers is a difficult game for me to rate. I had a lot of fun discovering spells at first, but to get all the triple-rune spells is nothing more than a chore. However, once you DO have all the spells, the game becomes more interesting.The devs clearly want this game to be tough as nails. While they may have succeeded, in doing so, the game becomes inaccessible to a broader audience, which I feel is a shame to an otherwise fun game. If I were to describe this game, it would be Kiting: The Game, because that's all you do. Unless you're using nuking strats, you're just circling around, spraying and praying to hit something, ad nauseum. I rate Runers a 7/10. There's a lot of room for potential, but as it is now, I imagine it will only appeal to diehard players.

Chibi-like 3D isometric roguelike dungeon crawler.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zZxUW2hQ5o

Clunky and messy with weird camera angles and rough controls, exploitable enemies and formulaic locations. And yet...yet it's also quite unique and charming in all the ways it tries to be different. Different enemy factions warring against each other, captives can be conscripted and dungeon traps can be used to your advantage.

Oh TinyKeep, you so quirky.

Real fast for people that didnt read the description fully like me, THIS IS NOT JUST A REVERSE SPACE INVADERS. Its incredibly political/metaphorical by relating to police brutality. Game is still good tho


The game starts normal at first, but as it progresses it gets a lot worse:

-In the game, your goal is to steer the crowd of people correctly so that only the yellow people are shot. You have a quota that grows over time, but after the 3rd level the quota is bigger than how many yellow people there really are. This means that you have to kill the innocent people in the crowd to progress.

-You have different messages each time someone is killed, depending on whether they were yellow or not. At first, it's simple supportable messages like "No to crime" when a yellow person is killed or just silence when any other is killed. However, it gets harsher as time goes on, scaling up to simply and bluntly insulting the yellow people or denying that the cop killed an innocent person.

-At the end of each level, you have a list on the people you killed and their occupation or crime. In the first levels, they are understandable crimes like murder and drug dealing, but the progressing levels give less intense "crimes" like loitering or just not wearing a shirt. In the final levels, they just become just like the other people and are listed as students and homeless men.

-The final level requires you to kill only yourself, as there is only one person needed for the quota and you are the only person left. There is no way to avoid it, and when you do, it asks you of your job and name. When you enter both things, it replaces your occupation with "addict" and claims that you were shot for resisting arrest.

Real cool game, definitely not what I expected. 7/10.

Ok, so the basis of the game is kind of lacking. You really, really have to pay attention to the details. That's not what's so disappointing, it's those kind that push you into it and you are really like wait a minute. What is going on here? After, like twenty minutes of the game, you finally get to the plot of the whole thing. And yes, there are aggravating parts like the traingular points, which really, really did piss me off. The art, isn't the best, the cut scenes are like a marshmellow. It's pretty bad. Very choppy. 
Why am I recommending this game? This game is for very specific people who really like to think about what they are doing. However, when you think about what you are doing, there's really not a reason to why it is happening. 
This isn't a horror game. Like at all. I think that's what I found disappointing about it. There's no creepiness or a tone that's like oh, I got the shakes. Rather it's the tone of, what the fuck am I doing? Wait, where was this room again? Talk to Nova AGAIN? Kind of game. Maybe it was just me, but I had bugs, I had it to wear I would click something and it would disapprove of my actions, but when I clicked the same thing again, it would approve the action. It was kind of frustrating to the core at times. There was just no direction. When looking at the femur and wondering what the hell to do, you clicked on Rune and he would give you something, but it was like a middle finger. All it said for me was, look at the femur. Like, yes, I have done that and even tried to cut it more. What else did you want me to do? Oh put it in water? How was I supposed to know this, etc.
The voice acting was, well, alright. It wasn't the worst, and it, well wasn't the best. When there was an intense scene, it was bland. It didn't make me scared or spooked, just the casual run of the mill day like everyday kind of attitude. Nova was low key, kind of annoying. I didn't see any chemistry between her and Rune. Tully was an ass-hat, and Al, was just there. They threw in another guy, that came like fifteen minutes before the game ended. They made him an asshole from the start. A snobby little shit. So, I guess I didn't get why he was so rude to all of them. But, he was kind of thrown in as if to make the game longer, he didn't really change the plot. So, if he was there or not, I don't think would have changed the outcome of the game at all. 
I would give this game a 4/10






Spoiler Alert: 
There is a sex scene (because yes, that's exactly what you need when facing a monster)

Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood-shed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be blood-shed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight

As a man of my word I’ve changed this review to recommend. But let it be known that the devs are whinny to say the least. Almost everything I had a problem with was fixed. But I'll never buy a DSW game again.

Original review below.

I wanted to like this, I really did. After the fantasy game (which I was not really into) I wanted me some Nekos. Too bad this is easily the buggiest DSW yet. I understand you are under constant pressure from the fan-base to get these out as quickly as possible but please, PLEASE fix the menu and controller bugs that persist from the first game.

Here are the problems I saw from less than twenty minutes of playing which included three restarts: 
Biggest one first, the menu is worse than ever. DSW has always had a bad UI, Nekomimi is an other level of frustrating; what was wrong with the Tinderesque phone from the first two? Instead, we get a horrible coded map; which sometimes accepts button input and sometimes changes to mouse only or simply stops working period. Pressing the button for the new “Milk Mode” causes the level to restart, but only sometimes. Pressing the button to save the screenshot doesn’t work, but only sometimes…. The bear icon on the map doesn’t match the level you’re on. And twice I had to restart the program because I couldn’t even click the “Yes” at the end of level, the button just spazzed out. 
Stage 3 can’t be completed to one hundred percent. There is 8% of clothes missing. 
The game opens browser tabs after closing. First time I closed the game my browser opened no less than three windows pointing to your Facebook page, this is totally unacceptable and what I would expect from some sort of malware and NOT a fun SHMUP on Steam.
Controller support is still really poor. From the intro to the end of every level the constant fighting to get my DS4 to work with this is by and far the most frustrating thing about the DSW series; this is nothing new and after four games really shouldn’t be a problem anymore.

But it’s not all bad. Nekomimi has the best art in all of DSW. Can’t say the same about the music, no game has come close to the OST of the first.  Gameplay wise, Neko has the smoothest controls the largest amount of weapons and a new “Milk Mode” which was worth a laugh. Disappointingly it’s by far the easiest with the lamest bosses, it’s not that interesting to fight different colored balls. The story, of what I’ve seen isn’t as good as Flat Justice but serviceable.

I don’t want to do this but I have to not recommend this. If you fix the game breaking menu bugs I promise to change this review, as I want to see your studio succeed, sadly this rushed title isn’t the way to go about that.

It's a simple and generic game but it shows promise and is constantly updated. The bad thing is at least for me is that every time the game gets a small update you can't play your saved games anymore. I might have just gotten the game at a bad time but playing the same thing every time I play is annoying.

I got this game for free, So my expectations weren't really high.

Let's say something positive:
+The game works, It didn't crash during the 1.7 hours.
+Gameplay works fine for me too. 
+Doesn't seem unfair.

BUT the major negative points are
- Absolutely no variety! Would it have been that hard to implement more weapons? more enemies? Customization for your ship? There's literally nothing you can do. And the ships even look pretty much all the same.... It's really boring ³.
- It's far too simple. There's literally no progress.
- You can't really alt+ tab out of the game

conclusio: played the game for the cards and the achivements. Not really worth 99 cents.
There's just so much unused potential. And that makes it boring. But the game's not broken, hence the positive review.

good game when it came out. then they changed the handling model the game now feels horrible the aero is weird as hell and all of the braking points have changed. surely an experienced game studio would've checked the handling model with experts before release. EA are really leaving their mark on Codemasters and its not a compliment

This is more of a neutral recommendation, this game does somethings bad, but a lot of things wrong.

Right off the bat, this game reuses all the assets from the previous game, but instead of being a linear story, you now start in a hub where you play mini-levels in any order you please, it is essentially a boss rush, and each boss is somewhat unique and not just copied and pasted from the previous game. Its almost like they had these ideas for previous game, but couldn't think where to fit them in, so they just shoved them all in into this game.

Battles can feel very clunky most of the time, and it seems devs have no other idea for difficulty than stun locking the player, until you figure out what to do in each level, you will die alot. But at least this time around, when you die, most enemies do not regen HP, so even if your only getting one hit before you die, you will eventually beat the boss. So basically the game will be either 2 hours long, or up to 4 hours depending on how bad you are at it.

This is not a review, this is a first-impressions write-up of the first 2.4 hours of the game.

I've only played a little bit of the game. There are definitely issues. The game has all sorts of problems from gameplay to especially the PC port. It's not unplayable which is good enough for me (60fps, controller support works) but it isn't good. No keyboard prompts but you can use it, although I wouldn't recommend it since you don't have any prompts and mouse doesn't work at all (at least they were nice enough to mention that in big orange text on the store page though, so that's fair enough), barebones video options menu (1280x720 or 1920x1080p, fullscreen or borderless + brightness settings, that's it), there's an issue with monitor refresh rates. Despite the game being locked to 60fps, if my monitor is running at 144hz it looks like my character has an afterimage while running around, it looks super jittery. Not great. There's no way to change the gamepad bindings either. You're stuck with the default controls and prompts.

The gameplay has its own problems. I wandered around for a bit wondering what exactly I was supposed to do. Through trial and error I explored and figured out everything I needed to know, mostly, only to find the game's main hub area and then get bombarded with tutorials regarding things I already knew about for over an hour (still going). Sometimes the tutorial would stop me dead while I cycled through its text boxes while enemies were about to attack me. There are numerous instances of bad design in this title and I can see why critics didn't shine to well to the non-reborn version which is apparently a lot worse if reviews are anything to go by. The combat and menus are a bit clunky, the map layout is absolutely stupid - why can't I see the overworld map AND the objective I'm trying to find on that same map? Why can I only see the objective marker on the freaking mini map where it's harder to figure out where it is + where I am???!?! The combat is initiated from the overworld but plays out in the overworld rather than being pulled to a different, isolated battlefield like other turn-based JRPGs. but aside from avoiding other wandering mobs, there really isn't anything added to the combat system by doing this. You can drive your tank or character around a group of enemies and even retreat but the combat isn't as good as it looks. You should be able to target weak points on larger enemies when you're in the tank and you moving around in a fight, by extension, your tank should have vulnerable spots for a risk vs reward playstayle where a frontal attack is the safest (that's where most tanks have all their armor, the front) but by trying to drive around the enemy to hit them in a theoretical weak point, your weak point would also in turn be exposed by that action. There's a lot of potential here and its a shame it just feels wasted at times....

But... man it's nice to play something that's actually kinda different. I don't play JRPGs almost at all because they are so infuriating at times. I see people mentioning problems this game has slow combat or poor ui and yeah its a bit slow but... have you played Final Fantasy 7? That game runs at 24 frames per second, has slow battles with lengthy animations and yet that game is never criticized by anyone in the press, it's considered by everyone to be the greatest game of all time somehow. How many JRPGs did you play where the first 4-6 hours are nothing but cutscenes and tutorials? "it gets good 30 hours in bro" is a common phrase you hear, and sometimes it's true. But why can't a game give you the reigns earlier on and leave you to your own devices for a bit? At least this game didn't waste my time with endless menus and garbage, it was nice to be on my own for the first hour or so of the game without having to deal with that crap. And the combat here is fun enough. It's quick and fast. It's not great but the sound design and soundtrack help hold it together, not to mention the unique combat system of utilizing a freaking tank. It's fun to upgrade it and try out different weapons. It's fun to find new enemy types and blast through them. It's fun to level up while doing all of this and getting rewarded a little bit for everything you do thanks to the games main quest and micro quest system. And even though the tutorial bits are annoying, I was shocked at first that a JRPG would let me wander around freely with almost no instructions or directions. It was absolutely liberating and I wanted to stick with the game to see where it went, I still want to see where it goes.

I think that's the main appeal I found. Good sound design, good music, and the exploration aspect of driving around and leveling up and finding new gear to equip you, your party and your tank with. They made the driving surprisingly enjoyable. I hate games that label themselves as "chill games" because they're so dull and unappealing to me but this one has my attention. It's got A TON of problems but it is something I think I can sink some more hours into when I have the time.

I'd say if you're looking for something a bit more cozy but still engaging, this game is worth your time for a JRPG if you're okay with the main gameplay loop - that being driving around and doing basic quests and grinding. Sounds boring if you've played a lot of bad JRPGs but I enjoyed this one.. Maybe not at 40 bucks though, I do agree that it's pretty high-priced for what it is. But it still means I recommend the game (at least if it's on sale). Again, I've barely scratched the surface so maybe the game turns into complete crap later but I started having fun 30 minutes into the game and for a JRPG that is a rarity.

Yes, a fun brawler with a lot of mechanics with four different characters.  Lots of bosses with varying enemies.  Good replayability.  My only complaint would be that the projectile and enemy health get kind of ridiculous on Legend.  Will probably drop trying to go through legend.  2 players it is probably much more manageable though...

It's... ok. It's main selling point is the brutal realism it tries to show off. Fire mechanic is cool. It spreads out and causes the grass and trees to burn up. The healing animations when you're low health are explicitly neat. A lot of people hate the gun-jamming mechanic when your gun gets worn out but I think it adds to more of the realistic setting Ubisoft was trying to go for. 

However, there are a few major cons. Guard Outposts respawn when you leave and come back. Driving through the world gets really frustrating and annoying really quick. These outposts are on every road and driving through them means you get shot up bad. If you're lucky you can drive through and manage to escape. But, most of the time, they cause your vehicle to break down. Forcing you to get out and fight them all again. Either that or a couple of them get into their gun-mounted vehicle and chase you to the ends of the map. 

Malaria was a neat mechanic. Added more urgency. However, it too got frustrating really quick. Going out of your way to get more pills isn't exciting. You drive up to an outpost, collect passports to give to another outpost on the other side of the map and generic family #4 give you 3 pills that will last you a few hours until you have to repeat it. 

Ubisoft apparently rushed the game out of the door, so the faction system never got put into place. So this means, no matter who you're doing a mission for, the mission giver always gives the cop-out line saying "Remember, this is top secret. So even our guys will shoot at you" FOR EVERY SINGLE MISSION. 

The story itself was a nonsensical slog. You get thrown into war-torn Africa with two warlord factions duking it out. And... that's about it. You work for both of them while shooting up both of their faction's people. They gladly pay for more work even if even if you just took out the guy's massive drug ring or something for the other guy 5 minutes ago. 

And finally, the voice acting. Everyone talks like they really need to take a shit and can't hold it in. There's a theory I read where, since Ubisoft Montreal developed it, the first voice actors hired were probably french. In case you don't know, french is a pretty fast-spoken language. So the other languages had to keep up with their french counterpart's dialogue.

So, why am I still recommending this despite giving an essay of cons? Because it's a neat game. You'll probably have some fun with it until it starts to get boring or you force yourself to get to the end. Plus, the last 3 ending missions were pretty cool. Also the map mechanic. I liked driving while holding the map. Now-a-days maps are on a pause screen and ruins immersion. ANYWAYS: Try to enjoy it for what it is and what Ubisoft was trying to do with it. 

I'd suggest looking up Far Cry 2 Redux or Far Cry 2 Vanilla+ even for your own playthrough. It makes the game more tolerable and makes my cons a little less annoying.

I was expecting a Diablo clone with pirates, but this is something else! You do get loot and fight scads of foes in real time combat but every weapon you receive has their own quirks and even mechanics (like reloading the pistol with a timing mini-game similar to Gears of War) and some items like the fiddle have multiple functions, summoning allies and items AND healing your small army of followers. The general systems are simple to learn but appropriately piratical. Swig rum for health, use gold unlock items, collect powder for guns and bombs.
It's refreshingly visceral in battle. Tossing bombs hurts enemies and allies and throws them around. Some enemies can guard against too many attacks from one direction so you need to vary your attack. Enemies can call on other enemies if you don't kill them fast enough. You can dash early in the game allowing you to outflank single enemies or retreat a short way from a horde.
It's all full of promise, fun to play, and I like the atmosphere a lot! 
Only real issue I had was the controls. You run in the direction you're facing which is a bit awkward. I wish there was an option, like Diablo, to select a location for the character to run or make it possible to drag the character around with mouse clicks. As stands get used to some accidental moonwalking.
But all told it's already exceptional as an early product. Looking forward to following the development!

I didn't play much of it. but by the looks of it very unbalanced and fun to play. The bigger units have loads of health and no way to insta kill them, the lowwer units die by every thing imaginable. Spells do a lot, and buildings seem weak. The look and feel of the game is very enjoyable tho. by no means a pro but It feels like a godo time waster and why else would you play card games ;).

I never reviews for products I recently purchased, but Godlike Burger deserves an exception! Imagine, you are running out of meat for your burgers and are expecting a massive rush in a few hours; what do you do? 
Hmmmm, I know! Lets kill that one customer who refused to tip and serve them as our next burger!

Indeed, Godlike burger is a mix of an arcade, stealth, and management game; where the user opens a space burger restaurant, and must find creative ways to kill and cook his customers, while managing any day to day activities that might come with running a restaurant.

There are countless ways to "obtain" your next source of burger meat, either by simply stabbing, shooting or burning your customers, or using hundreds of different, and elaborate traps to discretely butcher and serve them as your next sale.

Chances are, I'll update the review later as the game just was released, [strike] but the biggest issues would be developer interaction, in game bugs, [/strike] along with the lack of mouse support.
Despite the vast amounts of content in the game, I've spent hours playing it, and I suspect many others might do the same, so I would also ask for more content in future updates aswell.

Update: The developers are actively receiving feedback from the community, and have fixed many game-breaking bugs, with more updates scheduled.

Ok, I'll be honest, this game is terrible. Horrid. Broken from top to bottom. And it's the best time I've had with a game for ages. See, I was a huge fan of WW2 shooters growing up and this game...This damn game...It's like a parody of the real thing! From earthshaking explosions that have no impact on the environment, a stealth mission ruined in the first five seconds with your AI squadmate running face first into a room full of Germans, A ruined English church larger then the royal palace and the angry baked potato masquerading as Churchill (Actually it's the most historically accurate version I've seen in any media) shouting angrily at a official who seems moments away from jumping over the desk and beating him to death, this is no question one of those games so bad it's good. Haven't played long but levels are very short so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Got it for a buck fifty on a sale but I would have happily payed full price for the experience. 10/10

How to tell it, this game has a great potential to be the best JRPG available on Steam, but the slow-paced narrative is killing it. I hope the developer can learn that everyone can't be like the Persona series. Persona has a lot of fanatic fans that backed them up, but Caligula Effect isn't. So if you try to mimic persona, you should cut more useless dialogue and bring the fun. And don't mention the costume they are trying to sell; damn, I hope the outfit is available on Steam Sale soon because who can purchase all of them without Steam Sale? lol

Subject 13 is an interesting point n click adventure. It's a typical 3D point n click adventure in the style of Syberia or other similiar games, it keeps that charm while having more logical puzzles due to its newer age. The gameplay is good, although interacting with things might feel a bit clunky at first due to how the interaction menu is laid out.

The story is pretty basic but at the same time intriguing, you do want to know what's going on after all. The character is neither likeable or dislikeable, he's quite boring I suppose. The ending opens up for a possibility that we didn't get to know everything that was fully going on... perhaps building up for a sequel in the future?

So I said the puzzles were okay right? They were, until the final bullshit which is mine sweeper. If you hate mine sweeper, congrats you will hate this too.

Eitherway, recommended for fans of the genre!

Now have immense hatred for whales after maybe 14 of my guys died over the course of a few years.

The game works well, but one of the issues with it is the huge RNG-reliance. Battles are entirely depended on whether or not you are lucky or not. Like, very similar battles can end up in clean wins or most of your crew dead while the enemy is hammering away at you over and over. 

Preferably a way to speed up combat. While it could be for effect, it sometimes feels too slow for it's own good.

Fingerbones is as abstract and  disturbing as it is short in length. It is not your typical indie horror game. The game has a heavy, dark atmosphere that adds to the discomforting truth presented to the player.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
+ creepy and intriguing story
+ tense atmosphere
+ effective, still and silent enviroment
+ shocking message and revelation
+ effective, implicit storytelling
+ puzzles are relativley challenging but logical, tie well into the story
+ fitting background noise add to the horror
+ can be completed in one sitting (10-20min)
+ FREE

--------------------------------------------------------------

Cons:
- sluggish keyboard & mouse controls
- gameplay is coarse, consists of walking and reading notes (like 'Gone Home')
- backtracking is necessary
- graphics are very primitve 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:  

The shocking truth of the story is slowly fed to the player through a series of notes. The atmosphere and theme is dark and disturing in a way that goes beyond the blood, disgust and violence of most horror games. The game shows the terrible thing that a man has done, who is free and not bound by any rules. (sshh don't tell feminists about this game)

6.5/10

[h1]OVERVIEW[/h1]
Has-Been Heroes is a unique lane-based game with some rogue-like elements from developer Frozenbyte.

In Has-Been Heroes you take control of a pair of legendary heroes who are past their prime, and one eager young rogue keen to experience a life of adventure, and accept your most important quest yet: to escort the kingdom's young princesses across the land to school. On the way you encounter hordes of undead led by an evil ghost.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game is played in 2D, from a side-on view. Characters and enemies are drawn in a cartoon-like style, with basic animations. Backgrounds are a bit bland, but get the job done, with a different look to each level.

There are animated graphic-novel style cartoon cut scenes to move the story along, too.

One disappointment with the graphics is that the characters' appearances don't change as they equip items. There are a lot of different items to unlock and collect, but they don't have any visual impact. There's also not a lot of variation with enemies: you'll mostly see skeletons, skeletons, and more skeletons, with only a few different enemy types. It fits with the plot, I suppose, but a bit more variation would have been nice.

There's a low-quality texture graphics option available; beyond that options are only vsync, resolution, and full screen / windowed mode.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Sound effects and music are typical of the fantasy genre, with powerful musical pieces befitting an epic quest or battle, interspersed with jolly travelling-style music. There's nothing that stands out here as being particularly good or bad, but they're professional and they suit the game well.

Character voices are gibberish, which has a certain appeal, and there are a few very short spoken pieces.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Has-Been Heroes plays like a cross between Plants vs Zombies and combat from a Final Fantasy game. Each level has a number of battles, which are divided up into three lanes, with one of your three heroes in each. Enemies approach slowly from the right and as your heroes' attack cool downs expire they can attack the front-most enemies in their lanes. There are also various spells that can be unlocked and collected, each of which has its own effects and cool-down timer.

Making the combat much more tactical, though, is the ability to swap heroes after they have attacked. The game pauses on each attack, and you can move heroes about between lanes, allowing you to focus attacks on one particular enemy, or spread them out more evenly across the approaching horde.

Furthermore, each enemy has a certain number of stamina points, and each hero has a certain number of actions per attack. Match the number of attacks with the number of stamina points and you stun the enemy, providing opportunity for a quick hero lane swap and follow-up attack to do increased damage, and sometimes permanently reduce the target's stamina.

Doing damage to an enemy knocks it backwards a short way, too. This is good because if one gets all the way to your heroes at the left side of the screen then they'll take hits and quite possibly die. When that happens to just one hero, it's game over.

Although combat is the core of the game, there is a bit more to it than just battle after battle. Each level is procedurally generated and presented as a map made up of encounter nodes and roads between them. You start at the left of the map and choose a path through the nodes to the boss fight at the end, but you don't know what a node will contain until you move to an adjoining one. Other than battles, you can find empty areas, chests, camps, merchants, and more. But be careful: although the game will let you backtrack over your path on a level to reach unexplored nodes, each time you cross your previous path you'll lose a candle. Run out of candles and it's game over.

As with many recent games with rogue-like elements, game over in Has-Been Heroes is really just the beginning. Depending on how well you did, you'll unlock a number of spells and items that you can find or purchase in your next game. So although each time you start a game you start from scratch, you'll have a better chance of finding more and better improvements each time you play. Do well enough, and there's a whole host of heroes to unlock, too.

It's unfortunate that the game mechanics aren't explained very well. The tutorial introduces some of the basics, but that's all. There's no information provided about the level map, items, spells, chests, or any of the non-combat aspects of the game. Importantly, backtracking on the level map and the candles aren't explained at all, leaving new players with no idea what's going on, and there's no information at all about unlocking spells, items, or characters. The interface, though it looks nice, also provides little in the way of helpful information.

The game also becomes quite repetitive early on. Even though levels are procedurally generated and you can pick your path through each level, the lack of variation in enemies and no hero choice, at least when starting out, makes it a hard slog for beginners. Stick with it and you'll start to reap the rewards, but it's a shame the developers didn't provide at least a couple more characters to choose from at the beginning.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
+ Unique combat system
+ A LOT of unlockables
+ Steam Achievements and Trading Cards

- Game mechanics are not explained well, or at all in some cases
- Repetitive; little variation in enemy types

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Has-Been Heroes is fun, but flawed. The unique game mechanics are interesting, but the lack of information provided to players in the tutorial or game interface make it quite hard to pick up, and the lack of variation in enemies makes it feel repetitive quickly. If you have the time and motivation to go the distance, though, unlocking the vast range of items, spells, and characters will keep you playing for a long time.

Almost all the negative reviews for this game were written by incompetent kids. Reading other reviews you will hear complaints about achievements, difficulty, and a lack of warning of whats dangerous.

The third complaint listed above is the only reasonable complaint however it can be dismissed with about .5 hours of trial and error. After that time you should have a basic understanding of what is and isnt dangerous.

The most common complaint I have seen is that its too difficult to beat the game. Its a perma death rogue-like shooter. Read the tags before you buy a game it will actually end up saving you money if your not looking for a challenging game. Not to mention that after a little trial and error you find that the game is actually quite easy.

And the final complaint I have seen is about the achievements. The achievements appear harder to get than they are. Its important to note that each achievement asking you to get a certain number of kills or gather a certain amount of ammo is asking you to do it within a single run so if you die you have to restart. You need to have 1000 bullets in the top left corner of your screen to get the achievement. The rest of the achievements are self explanitory.

Ammo boxes are found from breaking boxes and doors. When you first start you should run around and see what your able to break and what your not able to break. Dont worry about ammo you will find much more than you will lose.

This is a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be. Eight game modes, achievements where some you can just let happen and some you gotta focus a lot and fitting music for each mode. Its something anyone can pick up and play and also attracts hardcore people considering stuff can get crazy. I'm great at this but not to where I can get all achievements, doesn't bother me.

The ones I suck at are the [spoiler] ice and lightning modes. [/spoiler]

The one I like but it makes me sad is the [spoiler] butterfly mode because since you eventually lose, those butterflies die... I want to kill that ****ing spider damn it!! [/spoiler]

My favorite ones are [spoiler] digging for gold and relics and the poker mode. Its so satisfying to get a Flush of 5 gems or clearing the entire screen when digging and get that 90 second mega bonus. [/spoiler]

So many clever ideas for a simple puzzle game, no wonder this puzzle game is advertised as the #1 puzzle game, its freaking crazy and clever.

Let's be honest: the name of this game says it all. Gratuitous Space Battles. A gratuitous amount of battles, in space. Tons of customizable options allowing for different tactics. The campaign mode keeps it interesting, especially when there are environmental factors that prevent you from using ships or abilities. Furthermore, campaign mode doesn't have a limit to how many ships you can take in to battle. Just let that sink in. Play the campaign long enough and you can drop a monster of a fleet on an unsuspecting planet. It's brutal and completely satisfying. Before you know it, you've wasted 10 hours, and you don't care, because you're about to skip sleeping to keep playing.

Very simple and straightforward game. What I really liked was how challenging it was to actually defeat Medusa with her bitch ass. Also, I find the charge attack to be a bit pointless, seeing as it's already difficult enough to hit her. Then again, there's always a way, and clearly I didn't find it.

I have played CM:SF, CM:BN, all prior to this Steam release of CM:SF2 (which is visually near-identical to V1), so the low hour count is not indicative of my actual playtime with this series.

DO NOT BUY if you're looking for some kind of military RTS *GAME*. CM:SF2 is an attempt to realistically simulate the subject matter, not provide a click-fest, apm game. It is expensive, clunky, the interface takes getting used to, the graphics are very dated, and it runs slower than you would expect, even on a modern system. Actual combat is brutal, entire truck loads of your men will get KIA by some random dude with an RPG, air support and arty takes what would seem like forever (but is actually realistic) to actually come down etc etc. You will also need to know a lot about the subject matter if you want to master the game. For example, what is the difference between an M1A1 and an M1A2 (and even sub-variants), or how is the USMC M1 different from the US Army M1, and that's just one tank, on the Blue Force side. How are USMC fireteams organised, and why are they different to to US Army, and so on. ELINT, night vision, FAC's, communication networks, ammunition count etc are all included, the list really does go on.

DO BUY if you like wargaming and military simulation. There really isn't any other software product that I'm aware of that does what this does. It simulates a small chunk of battlefield down to individual men and individual bullets. Units don't have 'health bars', vehicles have systems to be damaged or degraded, and men will behave like actual humans, running away or trying to cower behind a tiny bump of ground. It's not fast-paced, and favours correct tactics and knowledge of your own and the enemies capabilities.

[b]Briefly: [i]Pale Echoes[/i] is a turn-based RPG with a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting and hosting an unorthodox combat system with almost deterministic puzzle-like battles.[/b]

A cool thing about RPGMaker titles is that each of them presents their own quirks in the forms of combat (or sometimes the lack there-of) and particularly the story and setting.

For [i]Pale Echoes[/i] it is actually the remnants of that setting: A huge catastrophe has destroyed the world. There are only two survivors: a magical pixie humanoid called Spinel and her guardian, a human named Schorl who becomes our protagonist.

They take on the quest to cleanse and fix the devastated world.

[h1]Memory is the treasure...[/h1]

Not much is initially said about the strange pair of heroines. Instead, the introduction to the characters and the setting is organic: met characters (or their memories) and hidden lexicons all explain the setting bit by bit. Spinel the pixie also gives her own view of the situation from time to time.

Spinel has the power to open windows into the world of memories. While the real world is a wasteland filled with vile Echoes of the memories of people long gone, the world of memories is a beautiful place with all sorts of people, all talking about the upcoming end of the world.

Some of the people's memories are benevolent, and meeting them will add them to the party. Recruited memories are then used by Schorl (you) to fight the nasty Echoes. They will essentially form your party. However, Spinel sometimes needs memories to power the opening of windows, so you will inevitably lose a few when you infuse them for this ultimate sacrifice.

Level design is great: the world of memories is filled with all sorts of activity and objects, like cute little houses, wells and trees, often in at least two levels rendering the terrain interesting. On the other hand, real world maps are desolate wastelands with huge holes and wreckage covering most of the area and the pretty grass replaced by dirty, dead ground. The contrast between the two worlds is extreme and powerful.

That said, graphically the game isn't unique, supposedly (as noted by other reviewers) using lots of default assets. If you don't mind that too much, a good use has been made of those assets and I think the result looks excellent.

[h1]...and guardian of all things[/h1]

Other thing cool about RPGMaker titles is the diverse variety of combat systems. [i]Pale Echoes[/i] goes so far as to turn battles into puzzles.

Each battle is predetermined (i.e. there are no random battles) and the battle follows strict rules. At first it is actually confusing since all the default actions have been replaced but you'll get the hang of it soon and there's a convenient in-game tutorial.

Basically, you can summon three memories to fight for you each turn. Schorl can also attack herself. In the end of the turn the enemy echoes attack Schorl. Echoes disrupt Schorl's focus (i.e. health) and you'll lose the fight if it runs out. You will also lose if you run out of memories. However, losing only means that you have to fight again, and you never permanently lose memories by fighting.

The memories and sometimes echoes (enemies) have [i]attack types[/i] called moods that work similarly to rock-paper-scissors: attacking with a superior type lets you inflict bonus damage and likewise inferior types inflict less damage .

Attacks are also divided into fixed, group and multi attacks with fixed always doing 100 damage (unless being affected by a mood) to a single enemy, group attacks affecting every enemy with half damage and multi attacking 3 random enemies with half damage. Multi attack is the only random element of the game. Every memory also has a support ability like focus healing or attack buffing.

As all attacks of the same type do same damage, the only difference between memories is the extend of their attack types and support abilities. "Better" memories have just more diverse moods or attack patterns. Hence puzzle-like battles.

[h1]Almost flawless jewel[/h1]

On the technical side, [i]Pale Echoes[/i] is one of the most polished RPGMaker titles I've ever played. For instance I encountered no bugs at all (and I tend to stumble upon them by accident), there's a built-in fullscreen option (rare in RPGMaker games) and as extensive options as possible for RPGMaker.

The engine does pose a couple of technical issues: the lack of proper screenshotting in Steam requiring special procedures to take and upload them, and perhaps the controls if you are not happy with the default ones. However, the game does instruct how to change the latter. Myself, I used default controls and played with Xbox Controller without issues.

[h1]After the end?[/h1]

After beating the game it presents you with all manners of goodies to check, including the music box (to listen to all in-game music and also oldies), playing as different-looking characters or turning on the dev diary mode.

Dev diaries brought light to some game design elements and I found them very interesting since I'm dabbling with RPGMaker myself. Dev diaries are scattered across the game, so to read them all you would need to do a replay.

Fortunately there are two bonus modes for this: Plus and Perfection mode. Plus mode is the normal game but you retain everything from normal playthrough, and if you missed anything, there is a handy circle around it (convenient for completionists!).

Perfection mode has more difficult battles and it's more like a regular game since you have to recollect all the memories. You also have to be really strategic with infusing memories so as to not lose an advantage that would become critical later on. While the late game in the mode was done great, the early part does suffer from a potential need to reload since the early battles require very specific memories to win them. All in all I enjoyed the mode nevertheless for the challenge it presented.

In the Perfection mode one thing concerning combat became frustrating (as repetition often brings out that in games). Some group attacks or abilities would affect every enemy or character in turns, taking additional time even though the effect is exactly the same for each one. As the animation cannot be skipped it takes a relatively long time to wait it out. It would be better if the attack or buff would simply apply to everybody at the same time instead to save time.

[h1]Last words[/h1]

I think the game had only one true flaw: it was too short. Even if it was 4 hours long, which is actually quite alright for the price of 5 €.

But just as I thought the game had truly captured my interest, the ending loomed into the view. That said, the replayability provided by finding all of the dev diaries, the Plus mode and the Perfection mode extended that to 11 hours for myself.

All in all [i]Pale Echoes[/i] was a great RPG experience. For the first title of Wyrmling Productions, I salute: Nice entry to the scene!

If gore or seeing [b]animated, stylised, cartoon[/b] women being shot up in a doom-style gib and weapon system is not for you, do not play this game. You will not like it.

That aside...
The Citadel is an interesting game.

Coming into it, I expected some sort of Doom/Wolfenstein/Marathon style clone with anime girls.
I got that.

What I didn't expect to experience was the oppressive, almost stifling atmosphere of the game.
And I don't mean that as an insult - coming into it, I expected the gore, but the way it was done was in a way that genuinely disturbed me. While I am not sure this was the intent of Doekuramori, it definitely heavily played into this game.

In the same way that franchises such as 'Alien' or the first two 'Dead Space' games could genuinely disturb you with their visuals, the gameplay of fighting these possessed 'anime girls' and hearing their screams and explode into gibs has a deeply unnerving, perhaps fatalistic feeling each time.

I distinctly remember killing the first of the more armoured soldiers who carry an assault rifle. Blasting them apart with my pistol, a woman's scream could be heard as their body broke apart into bits and pieces, a forlorn expression on the woman's face with her helmet torn off from the attack. At this moment, the oppressive music, the quite dark visuals, and the sound design all came together to give me this extreme sense of dread.

It was a feeling that I hadn't really experienced in any game for a while. It wasn't sexualised, it wasn't some sort of fetish or anything of the sort. It felt like a matter of fact in this dark universe where you play a Martyr attempting to defeat some sort of old, ancient deity that had possessed your comrades and even the 'angels' you were supposed to follow and serve.

I think that the game needs heavy optimization, and the third, hardest difficulty is not easy to find - I haven't found it myself yet. And the second hardest difficulty - devotion, I believe - is not terribly hard once you've got a couple of hours' experience in the game.
Optimization and the general gameplay are some of its weaker points.

However, the enemies, environment, visuals and audio all come together in this strangely haunting visage of a very dystopian world. This game has heavy HR Giger, GiTS, and perhaps EYE Divine Cybermancy or Nechronica vibes to it, as another review mentioned. The gunplay - taking your powerful weapons and blasting apart your former allies in shocking ways - really hits this home.

The boss fights are also something regrettably quite dull, and seem to not serve as much purpose as they should outside of a single boss, the third I believe.

To conclude, this isn't a game that everyone would be comfortable playing. It requires a strong 'stomach,' as there are a great deal of 'horror' themes that may make you very uncomfortable from the get-go. However, The Citadel is a very unique game that goes for some controversial, unsettling, but very thought provoking gameplay and environment design that almost tells a story of its own. I really hope to see more from Doekuramori and to see them either improve Citadel further or move onto another project. It would be very enjoyable to see more of The Citadel's universe.

As a final note, those attacking Doekuramori about this being 'guro' or 'pornographic' are unfairly targeting this developer. I can understand people finding this game unsettling or disturbing, but from what I can see, that's the point.

The gameplay in Brink got repetitive really quickly for me, but what got me hooked was the story.

I love the story, how both sides have information the others lack and their distrust for the other side is really what got them all in this mess and started the whole war.

[spoiler]The Resistance knows that Ark was build for sustainability, and is why they are angry about rations and the lack of supplies. What they don't know is the Ark was built to be sustainable... For about 5,000 people... It was only an experimental city, it was never meant to house the now 50,000 people living on it. Which the Resistance does not know.

The Ark is able to float thanks to Arkoral, a material made from coral that allows it to float in the sea without degrading to the salt content. However, what Security does not know is that the Arkoral is becoming sterile and will soon degrade to the point the entire city will sink, something Chen, the leader of the Resistance, has kept secret, due to him believing they would brush it off, or would discredit him, ruining any political power he has.

Chen learns that there are people outside the Ark (Which destroys what little trust he had left in the Founders, learning that they had kept this secret) and believes if they can get their help, they can save the Ark and the people living on it. What he does not know is, when the founders found out about people surviving the flood they sent agents out to make contact with them. The agents were tortured to death for the Arks location... The Ark had to be moved which taxed it already dwindling resources. Now with the war growing and resources even more scarce, they can't move it again. If the Resistance makes contact with the outside, it will doom the ark.

Each side distrust the other and has kept secrets for one reason or another. If the Founders had told people that the Ark could only sustain 5,000 and that they have 50,000 living on the Ark, it could start a war for control of it or a purging.

If Chen told the Founders about the Arkoral, maybe they would work with him, maybe they would hide that information like they hid that there are survivors outside the Ark.

And what about the Arkoral? What if what ever made the water rise is also affecting the Arkoral. What will happen when the outside finds out that the Arkoral is useless and the only thing of value is the technology of the Ark itself?[/spoiler]

The plot and story of Brink is what really got me hooked, the Resistance thinks they are fighting for the people and are knocking tyrants off their crumbling throne. The Security believes that they are protecting the last bastion in the world, that they are making the best of a bad situation. That they are doing what is needed to save 50,000 lives.

Chen freeing the oppressed from a sinking ship.
Mokoena, the leader of security, protecting the people from terrorist.
The Founders, protecting the last bastion in the world.

No one person believes that they are evil. Everyone thinks they are the hero of their own story.

I would recommend playing this game for the story alone.

[h1]Weird things happen when you're...[i]At Home Alone[/i].[/h1]

[i]At Home Alone[/i] is a short, simple game that seems cutesy but takes some weird dark turns when you feel like glitches start occurring....when you later realize with each playthrough, that these are all intentional.  In the end, you will get some explanations...even in the secret area (via file manipulation), but you won't get a straight answer as to what exactly happened.  Even I don't know what I just experienced...

If you're looking for a [i]Mother[/i]-inspired game sans the battles and with basic story elements to get the point across, this is your game.  The development team (or developer) is Chinese, so the English translation may seem off in some areas, but it's tolerable enough to be playable.  This title should take you about 1-1.5 hours to get all achievements...maybe even shorter if you know what you're doing.

6/10  Reminiscent of the first [i]Mother[/i] game graphic-wise with a very creepy vibe to it.

[b]TL;DR: Little Witch Nobeta is good![/b] 😭😭😭

I bought this game with low expectations. I did not expect much more than a Unity asset flip that happened to be cute and funny. That is not what this game is.

Little Witch Nobeta is a third-person action game that is closer to a souls-like than the vast majority of games that claim to be souls-like. You play as Nobeta on her mission to reach the throne room of the castle. She is guided by a black cat along the way.

The style of the game is very cute. Nobeta’s actions and mannerisms are funny. But don’t let that deceive you. The mechanics of this game are comparable to Bloodborne, and the world that Nobeta inhabits is darker than Demon’s Souls. 

Nobeta is a witch. Appropriately, her attacks are all centered around spells. You start off with one element of magic and throughout the game you can find three additional ones. Everything is projectile based and each element has a different style of shot. One is like a shotgun. Another is a machine gun, and so on. Little Witch Nobeta is secretly a third-person shooter. The amount of spells you can cast at once is limited by your mana bar, with goes down with each cast but refills over time. Mana is also gained restored with each kill, or with Nobeta’s limited melee attack. You can also charge the spells, which grants additional abilities. After the first boss you gain the ability to parry, which also restores mana and does damage. The window is very tight however.

The game is not that hard. It is not easy, but it is doable on the standard difficulty setting. The advanced difficulty setting does nothing but make the enemies damage sponges, hit harder, and hamper Nobeta’s abilities. Just play on standard difficulty.

The varieties of enemies have slight weaknesses to different elements. But more so to different styles of attack, so you have to get creative. The enemy variations seem dull at first, but there are some twists that keep it interesting. The difficulty spikes as the game progresses, but it never gets too crazy.

In true souls-like fashion, the areas are interconnected by multiple routes. There are hidden walls in this game, hidden treasures, hidden movement mechanics, even hidden bosses. Exploration is immensely rewarding. Some areas seem like flattering fan versions of Demon’s Souls levels.

Saint statues are equivalent to bonfires. It is your respawn point, your level-up point, and your shop. You level up just like souls games, putting points into the stat or stats of your choosing. You can make Nobeta a glass cannon, or a tank, or a melee pure, or a balanced witch. There’s plenty to play around with here. Respawns are on a checkpoint system like all souls games, but there is little penalty for death. A feature that Little Witch Nobeta shares with the metroidvania Ender Lilies is that you can return to the last visited shrine at any time from the pause menu.

I think the story is what separates Little Witch Nobeta from the run-of-the-mill indie souls-like. The enemies and item descriptions in this game tell a story. The cut-scenes mostly do not, until the very end. The world of Little Witch Nobeta is extremely dismal. It is a world of intense racism, genocide, civil wars, caste systems, backstabbing, organ trafficking, grave robbing, torture, and slavery. I will leave the details for you to discover for yourself in the game. Like in the Souls games, the player character, Nobeta, is aware of these things but never voices her own opinions on them. She is very much involved, but in what way is left vague until the very end of the game.

There aren’t even a ton of glitches in this game. It’s hard to clip out of bounds or exploit the animations. It seems like the developer thought of everything. I tried to sequence break in a few places and there was an invisible wall. But not just any invisible wall. It was a magical barrier that had its own animations and Nobeta recoiled off of it quite cutely. There was a lot of detail and polish put into this game. It does not drag on too long when it runs out of tricks, although the very very last area fells a tad bit thrown together from watered-down ideas. But there is a new game+ and any costumes you unlock on one save file carry over to other save files. 

Little Witch Nobeta is legitimately a good game!😭😭😭

If you don´t like platformers and you bought this game, youre an idiot.

If you bought this game and dont like it for whatever reason you may have, you´re a tard.

Dear Dev,

if you are reading this review, i wanted to let you know why i decided to remove this from my account -

the simple fact is, some of your players (who've been playing this since whenever you first put it up on Steam) treat newbies like me who are confused as to why certain logic statements fail (like "if enemy | type | != | Boss" when the input to be compared is "BOSS"), as complete and utter morons for not knowing how your game works etc, or they assume that newbies (like me) have absolutely no clue, interest or understanding in learning how the game works, or how the logic condition statements perform etc...

the game itself seems to be fairly fine for those that prefer an idle game, but the playerbase isn't as helpful... nor is there any reference materials that players can refer to, except to ask the not-so-helpful playerbase (some of whom are fairly high horsed)

For other people;

I recommend the game, just not the long-term players offering their negative two cents in basic newbie questions

PS, there is no wiki or external site with information, so you're going to have to be treated like a complete idiot if you want help with the game, and i mean that in a negative sense!

The game has three levels of difficulty at the beginning. After playing on hard  expert difficulty unlock.Oh, that bothers me
but after that hardcore unlock.I do not recommend playing at all in this difficulty.Has the developer ever played hardcore? Are these levels complete? Or was it just made to annoy gamers?developer, please give us more powerful weapons or more money for each stage.
Of course if you see

Recon Control is a hardcore turn-based strategy game. The special thing is, that the battlefield works like a 2D platformer.

You command up to four soldiers mission after mission to gain control points which let you unlock the final mission. There are three operations (campaigns) with 25 different missions in total.

[h1]Equipment[/h1]
There are dozens of weapons, armor, and items such as explosives. Most of them you need to unlock first with gold. You get gold after finishing a mission (mostly 1 or 2). Unlocking an Item costs 1 or 2 gold, so you won't unlock much and need to think about what to get.
After unlocking equipment, you need to buy it with money before you can actually equip it.
This also works as an overall progression because everything you unlocked once will stay unlocked.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
The Game is very hard. There are no difficulty settings aside from playing a campaign in ironman mode. This doesn't make battles harder but you won't be able to restart or replay missions which can easily result in a failed campaign.

[h1]Battles[/h1]
Are very hard. You won't stand a chance if you just run through the building most of the time. One little mistake can cost you a soldier's life. It's brutal but very tactical once you get into it. At first, I felt it was too hard but after replaying failed missions, I got better, learned the game, and took advantage of that.
There are some ways to cheese through missions but overall, you will need a strategy. Leveling soldiers up, getting the skills and items you want is crucial to winning missions (especially without losing soldiers).

[h1]Skills[/h1]
Speaking of which, there are hidden skills you will unlock by playing and skills you can spend points for after a soldier won a mission. Every soldier still alive will get stars after a mission which you can spend on the skill tree. There are passive and active skills like "Kill an enemy with a pistol shot when you're standing right next to him" or "You regenerate X stamina every turn".

[h1]The Good[/h1][list]
[*]The difficulty. While there are some balance issues, it is in the right spot mostly. It's hard but fun for everyone who likes to think about what to do exactly.
[*]Add to that a pretty good AI most of the time.
[*]There are different types of missions (escort, destroy, kill).
[*]Hidden skills make the game a bit more unpredictable.
[*]Lots of content for a price this low.[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1][list]
[*]Sometimes enemies don't move when they're behind a door. I imagine this might be a bug or something because this happened after I killed a few guys already and most of the time, enemies will put you under pressure if they know you're there.
[*]When all your soldiers are on alert and an enemy comes in their line of sight, just one of your soldiers will shoot. The others wait for another enemy coming in the line of sight rather than shooting on the first target they see.
[*]You can cheese your way through some missions by waiting behind a door with all on the ability ambush (like overwatch in other TBS games). This way, you can kill one enemy after another. Since sometimes enemies won't put you under pressure, you can also wait for the bar to lose some momentum (There's a bar that fills up after every shot. When the bar is full, enemies will call for backup).
[*]There were no shooting sounds. This kind of destroys the atmosphere.
[*]The difficulty. I feel like it's in the right spot most of the time but the final raid of operation one is just too hard IMO. I know now a few tactics to get it done but for that to work, I need to relevel my soldiers which isn't possible so I need to restart the campaign. This feels like I'm on a dead-end and if you need certain tactics to progress in a game, it also feels a bit lame.[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Recon Control is a fun hardcore turn-based strategy game with a different take on the genre thanks to its 2D battlefield. While there are some bugs and balance issues, it's easy to overlook them thanks to a very tactical game on and outside of the battlefield. Considering its low price, it's well worth it.

If you're into turn-based strategy games and look for a hard challenge, Recon Control is the perfect game for you.

We accompany Lara on in her honeymoon (those, who played Memento Mori, the first game, will know, that she and Max had found together) and as usual for detectives, there is a case.  Two valuable artifacts are stolen from a museum.  Though Max still suffers from nightmares, Lara let him take the leading part in the investigation.  They find out a lot - and then it happens: an accidetnt and Max  is gone. Is he dead or what ? 

From now on, we play as Lara and solve mysterious murders in  various countries.  All deads have one in common: they seem cruel and all corpses are marked with sort of glyphs.  Ritual murders ? 

I won't say more to not spoil the story, which I liked much.  A lot of puzzles await us as well, some are rather time consuming or tricky to solve.  Not really necessary - more a minus in an otherwise really good game.

Still, I can for sure recommend this game!

This game takes the concept of an old movie, Death Race 2000, strips out the flailing political commentary, and replaces it with Britishisms, dick jokes, and British dick jokes.  It is an idiot game for idiots.

I am that idiot.

If you want to take a step back from the vast seas of idiocy, it's a technically interesting game that allows considerable, locational damage to be modelled onto a variety of cars fitted out for melee combat.  Slam into the rear corner of an opponent and your target crumples there.  Hit a wheel hard enough and it comes off, and the opponent is considerably hampered in performance. Granted, not as much as it might realistically, but this is a game and it never stops reminding you for even a millisecond.


There are powerups.  They do various reality-bending things, such as launch nearby pedestrians off giant springs, throw anvils at your rival drivers, or cause all your car's bodywork to fall off.  It's osntensibly about racing, but if you get bored you can just demolition-derby your opponents, or if you've got a cruel streak, methodically murder every last pedestrian on the map.  There are several hundred, it may take a while.

And, frankly, just about anything involving carnage (or racing?) will get rewarded.  The game doesn't care what you do.  Go hit things.  Go ram cars.  Go... turn a few laps, I guess?  Whatever floats your boat.  If you get bored hitting the AI and by some christmas miracle there are still people playing this, or you trick your pals into getting copies, then you can play against players instead of the AI.  Cool.

It's stupid, it's gory, it's got a really good damage model, and it's stupid.  Really, it's stupid.  I am, however, quite okay with Carmageddon's brand of stupidity, because in its own perverse way, it is as technically impressive as it is stupid.

Quite a good adventure with a good script (except Chapter 1), plot twists, some original and inovative puzzles and long gameplay time (over 20 hours). I am a Czech patriot (the game is from Czech republic) and give thumb up. And now the negatives:

- first chapter is the worst and easily expendable. Do not get discouraged, be patient
- various bugs (misplaced subtitles, different voices)
- long loading screens (even if you hit ESC and press Continue game ! )
- some unnecessary and stupid puzzles whose sole purpose is to make game longer. Fox example, you need scissors and you cannot just buy them, you must repair a hose and use it to hit flowerpot on 1st floor with scissors in it! Or you must print a page, but toner is depleted and you must replace it (wtf). Or you need white paint and even though your character is a painter, you are out of white (what a shame) and you have to find it elsewhere.

So if you have ever played this on console or dynasty warriors then you already know what you're getting. Samurai warriors shows you a little into the history of japan as dynasty does for china. it plays exactly like how i thought it would so i was not disappointed in it. Actually what really shocked me was you could play online vs dynasty which is only local. so i gotta give them credit for doing that function at least. my friend who played had never did any type of game like this. we enjoyed it. we did have a few crashing issues but we managed to get through it if i hosted. there is one bugged character which causes crashes. one annoying bug is you can't pause to look at the map in multiplayer. single player it works just fine.

the only other thing i have a problem with is the morale. no matter what the enemy does they always lost it. they never gained it back. so they pull some nasty move and look lost morale. what is the point of it you can't get it to work correctly. so despite the issues i saw i still think its a great game. the issues aren't game breaking except for masamune date. if you look in the dicussions people have mentioned it.

I recommend getting this game on sale.

[b]Story[/b]
It's another decent sci-fi horror story where the protagonist has to find the truth behind an infection, mutation, outbreak, etc. If you've experienced the stories of Resident Evil, Dead Space, Alien, etc - you'll see that Callisto Protocol doesn't tell anything new, but it follows the sci-fi horror formula well.

[b]Combat[/b]
Combat is a mixed bag. I personally found the combat to be very fun, especially when the player gets access to all three methods of fighting - melee, guns, and gravity glove, You perform combos on your target by chaining together melee attacks, gun fire, and projectile throws. You can even toss enemies at each other or into environmental hazards like spinning fans, spiked walls, and fatal drops. The dodging and blocking mechanics are very simple, but felt like a necessary addition for the melee-focused counterpart to Dead Space. It makes melee combat more enjoyable.

However, I found the combat to be most janky when engaging in melee combat with two or more enemies. The camera is very close to the protagonist and you're forcibly locked-on a single enemy in melee combat. This makes it difficult to see what other enemies are doing while you're focused on one. You can definitely get attacked by others while you're "dueling" your target.

[b]Content[/b]
As of the time of this review, the only main content is experiencing the story. There is currently no new game plus mode. You can start a new game on a different difficulty setting, but nothing from the previous playthrough will carry over. Future DLC will add more story, game modes, and content - but I firmly believe new game plus should always be a free feature. My first playthrough was about 9.5 hours long - this includes the main story and exploring as many optional areas as I found. Definitely looking forward to the future content!

The day one patch resolved the stuttering issues. After the patch, I found the recommended specs to be very consistent with the performance you get. There are very few areas or rooms that actually dunked framerates - which could be resolved by tweaking your graphics settings. There were no unplayable moments, but I hope future patches provide better optimization to prevent those rare frame drops.

Apparently the online was fixed and a lot of these reviews are a bit outdated now, the game is also sitting at a "mixed" score at the time of writing. Not sure about all that because I primarily play couch-coop exclusively and this is an immensely enjoyable game.

I don't even know what genre to describe it as, outside of co-op. You drive, you blast enemies and debris, you use lights to navigate darkness and also scare away light-sensitive monsters, you're constantly fishing for items to match up to get more resources to upgrade your boat, fuel your boat, or repair/reinforce your boat. There are unlockable characters and cosmetics and bonus/special missions in addition to even more enemy variety.

It's insane. I think this is a great game you shouldn't sleep on.

At first, this game feels clunky, confusing and unpolished (which it is). But once you get the feel of how it's made and what you need to do to successfuly complete the levels, it just clicks.

Yep, controls are not very intuitive and feels delayed. This alone makes the game harder than it actually is. Rescue missions are a real pain in the ass, because the hostages die from a single enemy hit. Graphics are tolerable, but animations could have been better. Feels a little bit stuttery and like it skips a frame or two.

And still this game is quite fun. You can certainly waste a few hours without noticing it.
